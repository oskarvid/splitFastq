## Split Fastq Files

This is a simple slightly overkill workflow I made because I needed to split fastq files by lane and I didn't want to do anything manually after starting the job.  
The workflow is not very user friendly as it is right now, not is the documentation extensive as you can tell. I may or may not put more effort into it. Just make a new issue if you have any questions or similar.
